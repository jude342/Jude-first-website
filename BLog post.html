        <h1>What do you get from dating online?</h1>
        <p>
            <i>
                Dating online is a bit hard &#128517; I experience it myself, but ofcourse there's a lot of things that you can learn from dating online especially when you talk to someone that is different from your culture and tradition, and that are the things that I'm going to share with you guys &#128521; <br> <br>
                Having someone to talk to is one of the most beautiful gift you'll ever receive in this world, but it is also depend on the situation. In the case of talking someone online, especially when it talk about dating, struggles from culture diversity can be one of the challenges that you will face. But we will not dive deeply into that, our todays learning will be depend on my personal experience. Firstly, dating online can give you positive or negative experience, but mine was really negative, I started finding someone online because I was confuse and lonely, that I wan't to have someone who I can talk to deeply and romantically. But as my relationship with someone online goes on, time was really flying by quickly, and I never realized that I'm being super deeply with that person which I thought a good thing, but when unexpected expectation came, which my plans and standard does not achieved by that person. My feelings started to lose and later on become uninterested, which made me hurt that person online in the following days, which I regreted the most, since I was the one who came to her life, and I'm also the one who broke her life. <br> <br> 
                That's why I want to share that always know your interest and goals before diving deeply into a relationship with someone, especially in the other country online who has different culture and tradition. So that later on, when you do these advice, and suddenly meet someone online, your feelings can not be easily destroy by standard expectation, or what they called beauty expectation. <br> <br>
                Thank you for reading this experience story. Before you leave, I will provide below some of our favourites songs and video that we listen, and watch together &#128521;
